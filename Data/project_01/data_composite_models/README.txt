Composite modeling

360-bp sequence, only dA residues

Protein 1: 1KX5, binding position 076
Protein 3: 1KX5, binding position 286

Protein 2: mid-point (MID) at pos 181

Mxy = minus; protein 2 binding positions are less than 181, from 160 to 180

Pxy = plus; protein 2 binding positions are more than 181, from 182 to 202

STD = standard model that does not include a middle kinking protein
