## NucDNA Contact Profiling Project

The data here was curated by Dr. Stefjord Todolli for his 2021 Journal of Molecular Biology publication. These .pdb files can be used for analysis with 3DNA and with DSSR for contact mapping.

There are 4 primary sources in the 'literature' directory that will act as the starting point for this project.
